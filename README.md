Course Project for Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data Course

The r-script "run_analysis.R" takes data from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones data set (available at https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip ), processes it, and prepares it for further analysis.

The script works assuming all data is available in and uncompressed format in the working directory.

The averages_data.txt file contains the output data after applying the script.

The CodeBook.md file describes the variables, data, and transformations that were performed in processing the data.

##Project Summary

The following is a summary description of the project instructions

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
