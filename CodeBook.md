#Data Set Information (from Original Source):

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

Attribute Information

For each record in the dataset it is provided:

Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope.
A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.
Its activity label.
An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

#Variables and Transformations

x_train, y_train, x_test, y_test, subject_train and subject_test contain the data from the downloaded files.
x_set, y_set and subject_set merge the previous datasets to further analysis.
features contains the correct names for the x_data dataset, which are applied to the column names stored in mean_and_std_features, a numeric vector used to extract the desired data.
A similar approach is taken with activity names through the activities variable.
complete_set merges x_set, y_set and subject_set in a dataset.
Finally, averages_data contains the relevant averages which will be later stored in a .txt file. ddply() from the plyr package is used to apply colMeans() and ease the development.
